    "Cell segmentation aims to simplify an image so that it can be better and easier analyzed. Cell segmentation makes it easier to determine cell boundaries precisely, which then help to further examine cells in terms of the phenotype of the cell (e.g. cellsize, cellshape), to count the number of cell nuclei and to better localize the cells. Therefore insights into the characteristics of the cells for example cell migration and proliferation by using time-lapse microscopy (Ulman, V., et al. 2017). There are several different image segmentation algorithms for example Thresholding (Otsu, N. 1979), k-means clustering (Dhanachandra, N. et all. 2015) and Region growing (Nock, R. and Nielsen, F. 2004). Thresholding is a simple segmentation method. The gray-scale image is binarized, meaning that the pixels are assigned to foreground and background dependent on the threshold. Thus pixels below the threshold are assigned to 1 and pixels above the threshold are assigned to 0. Otu's Thresholding allows for the selection of a threshold automatically (Otsu, N., 1979). \n",

In the attributable studies they found out about UV-damaged Chromatin in embryonic stem cells by detecting different amounts of Oct4 accumulations. The images were receive using the confocal microscope Leica TGS SP5. (Bártová, E. et al., 2011). The main challenge of this dataset is the low contrast as well as stained parts within the cells. \n",

A larger filtersize will result in removing of more noise, however edges will become more blurred.

    "Otsu thresholding is not selective for bright spots, reflections or artifacts, which arise from the image acquisition process and data transmission during microscopy. As a reason for that, pixels are assigned incorrectly to the foreground and thus identified falsely as cell nuclei. To solve this problem, Otsu's method can be extended to multithreshold problems, respectively two-level Otsu thresholding can be performed. The fundamental principle is to set two threshold values, which divide the image into three pixel classes. The optimal set of threshold values is determined by maximizing the between-class variance between the three pixel classes as followed (Otsu, 1979):\n",

    "The higher threshold intensity value is used to remove the bright spots and reflections from the original image, whereas the lower threshold value separates the cell nuclei from the background. In order to receive a binary image, all pixels with a lower or equal intensity level than the lower threshold value as well as all pixels with a higher intensity value than the upper threshold value are set to 0 (background). The remaining pixels, in rage between the lower and upper threshold value, are converted to 1 (foreground). Furthermore, two-level Otsu thresholding can be used to segment images in which the objects, such as cell nuclei, can be divided into two groups in terms of their intensity values. These features are represented in the images of the N2DH-GOWT1 dataset, in which the cell nuclei seem to be distributed at different levels. Ideally, the two thresholds would separate the cell nuclei from eachother, but also from the background. In this case, all pixels with a higher intensity level than the lower threshold and all pixels with a higher intensity level than the upper threshold are set to 1. The pixels with a lower or equal intensity value than the lower threshold are set to 0.\n",

    "<h4><b>Local Adaptive Thresholding</b></h4>\n",
    "<p style = 'text-align : justify;'>\n",
    "Although, global thresholding is very fast and provides reliable results in most cases, it is susceptible to non-uniformal illumination, considerable background noise and varation in contrast (Singh <I>et al.</I>, 2011). As a reason for that, pixels can not be clearly assigned to the foreground or background, which results in unaccurate segmented images. In order to overcome this problem, the implemented global segmentation method, can be extended to local tresholding, being a more appropriate and accurate binarization method. Local thresholding uses non-overlapping windows to divide the original image into a distinct number of regions and to determine the optimal threshold of each. Due to contrast and illumination variation even in small regions especially in the NIH3T3 dataset, local adaptive thresholding is performed by using overlapping windows. The key idea is to use a sliding window, a  rectangular frame of a fixed size, which iterates over the image and calculates a unique threshold value for each iteration by Otsu thresholding, --- derived from the grayscale information of its local neighbourhood pixels --- /not really what we do in our sliding window/  (Singh <I>et al.</I>, 2011). To assign each pixel to the foreground or background, two possible options were elaborated. On one hand, the optimal threshold intensity value can be determined by averaging the threshold values, which were assigned to the pixel. By performing image clipping afterwards, a binary and segmented image can be received. On the other hand, each pixel can be assigned to the foreground or background, by checking to what the pixel has been assigned to more often. To achieve efficiency and accuracy it is important to select the right stepsize and window size. Since the calculation of the threshold value from the local neighbourhood is to be applied to each pixel in the image, local adaptive thresholding algorithms are often slower than global thresholding algorithms. \n",
