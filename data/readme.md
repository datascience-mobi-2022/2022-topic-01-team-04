## Description of datasets

#### Cell Nuclei Segmentation
The image data for cell nuclei segmentation with Otsu thresholding consists of three different datasets. The first dataset consists of 6 images showing 
GFP transfected GOWT1 mouse embryonic stem cells. The images have a size of 1024×1024 pixels and show 10–20 cell nuclei per image. 
The second dataset consists of 18 images of mouse embryonic cells stained with Hoechst. The images have a size of 1344x1024 pixels and include around 
60 cell nuclei per image. The third dataset consists of four images with HeLa cells stably expressing H2b-GFP. The images have a size of 1100×700 pixels 
and show 30–50 cell nuclei per image.
